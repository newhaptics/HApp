The GraphicsEngine class is a custom Python class that allows you to draw 2D geometric features on a matrix using PyCairo. It is initialized with its dimensions like GraphicsEngine((4, 3)). The class provides the following methods for adding and drawing various features:

addPoint(coordinates): Add a point to the image with the specified coordinates.
addLine(startPoint, endPoint, width): Add a line to the image with the specified start and end points and width.
addCurve(controlPoints, width): Add a quadratic Bezier curve to the image using the specified control points and width.
addTriangle(vertices, width): Add a triangle to the image with the specified vertices and width.
addCircle(center, radius, width): Add a circle to the image with the specified center, radius, and width.
addEllipse(center, major_axis, minor_axis, angle, width): Add an ellipse to the image with the specified center, major axis, minor axis, rotation angle, and width.
addArc(center, radius, start_angle, end_angle, width): Add an arc to the image with the specified center, radius, start angle, end angle, and width.
addPolygon(vertices, width): Add a polygon to the image with the specified vertices and width.
addRectangle(startPoint, endPoint, width): Add a rectangle to the image with the specified start point (top-left corner), end point (bottom-right corner), and width.
addQuadrilateral(vertices, width): Add a quadrilateral to the image with the specified vertices and width.

After adding the features, you can use the drawFeatures() method to draw the features onto the matrix, and the showImage() method to display the resulting image.

example code drawing of a small person:
engine = GraphicsEngine((500,500))

# Head
head_center = (150, 150)
head_radius = 50
engine.addCircle(head_center, head_radius, 2)

# Body
body_start = (100, 200)
body_end = (200, 300)
engine.addRectangle(body_start, body_end, 2)

# Left arm
left_arm_start = (50, 200)
left_arm_end = (100, 250)
engine.addRectangle(left_arm_start, left_arm_end, 2)

# Right arm
right_arm_start = (200, 200)
right_arm_end = (250, 250)
engine.addRectangle(right_arm_start, right_arm_end, 2)

# Left leg
left_leg_start = (100, 300)
left_leg_end = (130, 400)
engine.addRectangle(left_leg_start, left_leg_end, 2)

# Right leg
right_leg_start = (170, 300)
right_leg_end = (200, 400)
engine.addRectangle(right_leg_start, right_leg_end, 2)

# Draw features and show image
engine.drawFeatures()
engine.showImage()

Using the GraphicsEngine class, create 10 application icons that fit within the GraphicsEngine canvas.

using a GraphicsEngine((4, 3)).
