This UML class diagram represents the HapticsEngine system and its interconnected components. The HapticsEngine class acts as the central hub, managing resources such as flags, operations, peripherals, and visualizations. The system relies on the FlagManager, OperationManager, PeripheralManager, and VisualizationManager classes to manage their respective resources. The FileManager class is also part of the system, although it is not directly connected to the HapticsEngine in the diagram. The Operation class serves as a base class for specific operations, such as the UpdateMonitorOperation class. The OperationTimer class is responsible for managing the execution of operations based on the specified conditions and timing parameters. Overall, this diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the HapticsEngine system's architecture and its interconnected components.
